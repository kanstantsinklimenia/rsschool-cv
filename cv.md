## About me
I started my career in a leading insurance company in Belarus when I was 18 years old. Then I worked in a clothing store and in a pizzeria.
My acquaintance with the IT-sphere began at the beginning of 2020. Then I worked as an auditor's assistant on a project in an IT company. And since that time, I began to be more interested in various areas in IT. 
At the beginning of 2022, I learned about the RSSchool and decided to learn more about the IT.
So here I am :)
